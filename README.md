# React + TypeScript + Vite
This is a simple Quiz App made by me during my Intership at Bytewise to revise my concept. This Time I used Typescript to built this and learn that there is no use of using typescript if you are working alone.
## My Notes
- CRA(create react App) is dead, use Vite or parcel as build tool.
- JS is a loosely typed language, meaning that we do not require to specify the variable type.
- Use shift + alt + F to auto indent
- Process to Publish
- - git init
- - git remote add origin https://github.com/Burhan-Ahmed/Quiz-App.git
- - git add .
- - git config --global user.name "Burhan"   
- - git config --global user.email "burhan.ahmed60090@gmail.com"
- - git commit -m 'DONE'
- - git pull origin main
- - git push -u origin main
