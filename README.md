## Point to Ponder

- Sync(Blocking "writeFileSync") mean that everything is done step by step
Async(Non-Blocking "writeFile") mean that everything is done without stoping the execution even if a function take more time to excute

- The server indeed doesn't "request" in the traditional sense. Instead, it listens for incoming requests from clients.

- .get mean to get data from some resource and .post mean to send data to some resource?
