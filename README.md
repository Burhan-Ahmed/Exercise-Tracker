# User-Auth-App
A task for the leaning of ExpressJs during my internship

## Tools and Language Used
- ExpressJs
- Postman
- EJS (Embedded Javascript)

## Point to Ponder
- Since I am working on backend and do not have a UI. Thus using ejs for Server-Side Rendering.
- Sync(Blocking "writeFileSync") mean that everything is done step by step Async(Non-Blocking "writeFile") mean that everything is done without stoping the execution even if a function take more time to excute.
- The server indeed doesn't "request" in the traditional sense. Instead, it listens for incoming requests from clients.
- .get mean to get data from some resource and .post mean to send data to some resource.
- Use ejs to get a ready to go UI for your Backend Envirnment.
