# Express-Project
A Backend Project that I did as an Internship task at Bytewise

## Languages and Tools
- Express
- NodeJs
- MongoDB
- EJS (for FrontEnd)
- Tailwind
- Nodemon

### Apply Tailwind in your Project via CDN <br>
`<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`

## Points to Ponder
- Always try to create Database locally, then you may manage it via MONGO compass.
- Right now, creating DB on Compass and connecting it to local machine is tricky.
