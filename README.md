# React Jobs Website
This is a Internship task done by me at Bytewise.

# My Notes
- Routes is like a container (parent) which is used to hold multiple route (child) inside of it.
- Both are used in react-router-dom
- Navlink and Link also work the same but Navlink provides with an additional attribute. (ActiveClass)
- When you use flex then you should use space-x-5 or space-y-5 and when you use grid then you should use gap-5
- Basically, this is because Tailwind CSS provides specific utility classes designed for different layout systems.
